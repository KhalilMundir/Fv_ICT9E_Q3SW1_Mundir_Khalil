		<td>Gen. Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) has ruled the oil-rich North African country of Wadiya since he was six years old, when his father was killed by 97 stray gunshots and a hand grenade while hunting. After another body-double is assassinated, Tamir (Ben Kingsley), Aladeen's uncle and most trusted adviser, persuades her to travel to New York. Unfortunately, Aladeen receives a hostile reception from exiled Wadiyans who want their homeland free of his oppressive control.</td>
		<td>Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Megan Fox Jason Mantzoukas Ben Kingsley John C. Reilly </td>
		<td>"The Dictator" is not only nasty, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, and crude, but it is also amusing. Having heard Sacha Baron Cohen promote it on innumerable talk shows, I was concerned that the film would feel like deja vu. But no. He stakes a claim to being the best comedy filmmaker currently working. And in a lecture about dictatorships, he engages in brutal political satire.</td><td><p>Rating:⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td>

		<td> Set in the fictitious Barangay Husay, Eman joins forces with his two buddies, Toto and Carlo, who begin as underdogs, failing at every opportunity to succeed in their small-scale frauds. They soon encounter Nicoy, who joins Eman's organisation, breaching the custom of just three members per gang.</td>
		<td>Pepe Herrera Paolo Contis Jerald Napoles Jelson Bay	Kate Alejandrino Pen Medina	Dindo Arroyo Raffy Tejada Gary Lim</td>
		<td>Normally, Philippine humour is all about slapstick with no real plot. I despise Tito-Vic-Joey films in which it appears like the performers were given a one-page script and told to behave naturally. For me, it is terrible and insulting for Filipinos to have to go through films like that, but because they feature popular actors, these types of films usually make it to the box office.</td><td><p>Rating:⭐⭐⭐</p></td>

		<td>When struggling boxer Joma (Zanjoe Marudo) moves in with his long-lost mother Sylvia (Dolly de Leon) and his autistic pianist brother Jayjay (Elijah Canlas), he struggles to fit in with a family he hasn't known in years.</td>
		<td> Zanjoe Marudo Elijah Canlas Dolly De Leon Michelle Dee Tirso Cruz III Bart Guingona Katya Santos</td>
		<td>Years can pass and your life can be peaceful, with no problems and everything going smoothly. Other years can be filled with heartbreaking news and losses that you can't believe will happen all at once. This is also based on personal experience. You never know when life will deal you a new deck of cards. In the film, Sylvia (De Leon) is a single mother with two sons, Joma and Jayjay. Sylvia has lived with her youngest son, Jayjay, for many years. Her older son Joma was never truly in the picture.</td><td><p>Rating:⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td>
